# QKD-Using-Mininet

QKD (Quantum Key Distribution) Simulation with Mininet 
This project simulates the BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol using Mininet and Python. It demonstrates secure key exchange between two hosts (Alice and Bob) while optionally simulating an eavesdropper (Eve).

## Introduction

Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a secure communication method that uses principles of quantum mechanics to generate a shared, random secret key between two parties. This project simulates the **BB84 protocol**, one of the foundational QKD schemes, within a Mininet network environment.

Mininet is used to emulate the network topology while Python handles the BB84 QKD simulation.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- Mininet  
- Python standard library `random` module (no external installation needed)  

---

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Mininet:**  
   Follow the official installation guide here: [Mininet Installation](http://mininet.org/download/)

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
3. **Run the Simulation:**
Ensure you have the necessary permissions to run Mininet commands, typically requiring sudo.
  ```bash
  sudo python3 qkd_simulation.py
  ```
Interacting with Mininet CLI: The script will launch Mininet and print the keys generated by Alice and Bob, as well as the bits intercepted by Eve.
Exit Mininet CLI: To exit the Mininet CLI, type exit or press Ctrl+D.

## BB84 Protocol Overview

The BB84 protocol securely generates a shared cryptographic key through quantum mechanics principles:

1. **Generate Bits and Bases**
   - Alice generates a random bit sequence.
   - Alice randomly selects a basis (`+` or `×`) for each bit.

2. **Encode Bits**
   - Alice encodes the bits into quantum states based on the chosen bases.

3. **Intercept and Measure**
   - Eve (the eavesdropper) may attempt interception using random bases, introducing potential errors.

4. **Measure Bits**
   - Bob receives and measures the bits using his own random bases.

5. **Key Sifting**
   - Alice and Bob publicly compare their bases.
   - Bits where their bases matched form the **final shared key**.

## 🖧 Network Topology

The simulated network topology includes:
  Two hosts: Alice and Bob.
  One switch connecting Alice and Bob.
---
## Simulation Execution
The simulation script (alice_bob.py) performs the following actions:

Sets up the Mininet topology with one switch and two hosts (Alice and Bob).
Runs the BB84 QKD simulation to generate keys for Alice and Bob, and simulate Eve's interception.
Prints the resulting keys and intercepted bits.
Launches the Mininet CLI for further interaction.
To start the simulation, simply run:
```bash
sudo python3 qkd_simulation.py
```
This will initialize the network, perform the QKD simulation, and open the Mininet CLI for additional commands or inspection.
